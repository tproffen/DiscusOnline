  In this exercise we look at the Fourier transform of a centrosymmetric
  structure and a very similar structure that is no longer centrosymmetric.
  Situations like this are often encountered at phase transitions from a high
  temperature to a low temperature phase.
  <P>
  The centrosymmetric structure (left) has two atoms, with the silicon at a 
  special position. The acentric structure (right) is distinguished only by 
  a slight shift of the silicon away from the center of symmetry.

  The Fourier transforms were calculated for one unit cell along a line 
  through reciprocal space parallel [111]. The left image below shows the 
  intensities of the two structures superimposed. Hardly any difference is 
  visible, just a few tiny <font color="#0000FF">blue spots</font> show at 
  the outer part of the Fourier transform. The complex structure factors
  for both structures are shown in the middle and right picture, respectively.

  The real parts (<font color="#0000FF">blue</font>) are practically identical,
  the imaginary part (<font color="#FF0000">red</font>) of the 
  centrosymmetric structure (middle image) is zero while the corresponding
  imaginary part of the acentric structure is non-negative. Notice that the
  imaginary part does not reflect the oscillations visible for the real part.
  These oscillations are caused by the interference of the six oxygen atoms in
  the unit cell. The oxygen does not contribute to the imaginary part, this is
  only due to the silicon atom moved by -0.01,-0.01,-0.01 ! Accordingly the
  imaginary part oscillated slowly with a period of ten reciprocal lattice
  constants along [111].
  <p>
  Last, lets have a detailed look again at the phase of the scattered wave
  in both situations.

  <p>
  The phase of the wave scattered by the centrosymmetric structure is zero  or
  180 degrees (<font color="#0000FF">blue curve</font>). The absolute value 
  of the phase scattered by the acentric cell (<font color="#FF0000">red
  </font>) is similar, especially in the center of reciprocal space.
  It can, however, assume any numerical value between -180 and + 180 degrees.
  Furthermore the phase of hkl and -h-k-l has the opposite sign. Unfortunately
  Friedel's law has this difference disappear, which makes crystallography
  both difficult and exciting.
  <p>
  The students will learn from this exercise:
  <ul>
    <li>Slight deviation from centrosymmetry causes only minute changes of
        the real part of the scattered wave, while the imaginary part, and
        thus the phase, may vary considerably.</li>
    <li>The intensity will change only very little, which makes it difficult
        to distinguish between a centrosymmetric and an almost centrosymmetric
        structure.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  Possible extensions of this exercise:
  <ul>
    <li> Have the students shift the silicon by +0.01,+0.01,+0.01 and ask them
         to explain the differences that follow. A discussion on absolute
         configurations may follow.</li>
  </ul>
