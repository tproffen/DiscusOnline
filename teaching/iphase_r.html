        <font color="#000099">Example 1:</font>
        <ul>
          <li>The intensity is independent of the atom position. Since this
              is the only directly accessible value in a diffraction
              experiment, crystal structure determination is still an
              exciting field.  </li>
          <li>The real and imaginary part of the diffraction pattern do 
              change. With the atom at 0.0, the imaginary part is zero, 
              while the real part is a smoothly varying function of h.
              As you start to shift the atom away from the origin, the
              real and imaginary part begin to oscillate. This is not to 
              be confused with the oscillation that you observe when you
              add more atoms to the line. The real part stays symmetric,
              i.e. Re(h) = Re(-h),  while the imaginary part is antisymmetric,
              i.e. Im(h) = -Im(-h). The phase angle varies in a saw-tooth
              like fashion. For an atom shifted to x, it is periodic with 
              a periodicity of 1/|x|. Just
              like the imaginary part, it is antisymmetric.  </li>
          <li>Switching from a positive shift to a negative shift switches
              the sign of the imaginary part and the phase angle.
              </li>
          <li>If you change the atom type while keeping the position, the 
              intensity changes according to the square of the atomic form 
              factor. The phase angle, however, remains unaffected. </li>
          <li>Changing from X-ray to neutron diffraction changes the 
              intensity, the real and imaginary part. The X-ray intensities
              are equal to the square of the atomic form factor, while the
              neutron intensities are independent of <i>h</i>. Correspondingly,
              the real and imaginary part of the neutron diffraction 
              pattern do not show the systematic decrease with increasing 
              <i>h</i>. The phase angle is identical for X-ray and neutron 
              diffraction. </li>
          <li>The phase angle increases linearly from zero degrees at h=0
              to 180 degrees at h=1/(2x) for a positive x coordinate. It
              then jumps to -180 degrees and increases again to 180 degrees
              at h=3/(2x). If you shift an object in real space, its 
              Fourier transform suffers a phase shift of 
              e**(2pi <i>i</i> hx). Look at the argument 2pi <i>i</i> hx.
              This argument increases linearly with h. Taken modulo 2pi, it
              becomes a a periodic function of h. </li>
        </ul>
        <p><hr><p>
        <font color="#000099">Example 2:</font> 
        <ul>
          <li>If you have two identical atoms at +x and
              -x, the imaginary part is zero. Since the real part 
              oscillates between positive and negative values, the phase
              angle jumps between values of 0 and 180 degrees. As you
              start to shift the whole molecule along the x-axis, you
              get an additional phase angle due to this shift. 
              Although the molecule conserves its internal center of 
              symmetry, the overall shift creates an antisymmetric 
              phase angle. </li>
          <li>Since a linear phase shift is added to all points in reciprocal
              space, the relative phase between two points does not change!
              Compare this linear shift to the shift you get in exercise 1
              when you move the single atom by the same amount as you 
              shifted the pair in exercise 2.</li>
          <li> Two important consequences arise: i) You can move your crystal
              a bit to the side during a diffraction experiment, the relative
              phases do not change. ii) You can artificially move the atoms
              within the unit cell by assigning a linear phase change to all
              reflections. This is referred to a "origin fixing" during 
              crystal structure determination.</li>
          <li>If you maintain the positions at +x and -x, but change 
              one of the atoms to a different type, the phase angle 
              becomes a smoothly varying antisymmetric function. </li>
          <li>The periodicity of the phase angle for two identical atoms
              at +x and -x is 2/x. </li>
       </ul>
