    <font color="#000099">Example 1:</font>
    <ul>
      <li>The axes in real and
          reciprocal space are perpendicular to each other. The 
          a axis stands normal to the b<sup>*</sup> axis and the
          b axis stands normal to the a<sup>*</sup> axis. </li>
      <li>As you increase the length of the b axis, the corresponding 
          length of the b<sup>*</sup> axis decreases.</li>
      <li>In our
          two-dimensional example, the lengths of the axes are:<br>
          a<sup>*</sup> = 1/(a sin(&gamma;) ), 
          b<sup>*</sup> = 1/(b sin(&gamma;) ), 
          &gamma;<sup>*</sup> = 180&deg; - &gamma;
          </li>
      <li>As you rotate the complete structure, the diffraction
          pattern is rotated as well. </li>
      <li>Shifting the complete pattern has no effect on the
          scattering intensities. </li>
      <li>The number of atoms influences the width on the Bragg 
          peaks in the corresponding direction. As in the 1D example, 
          increasing number of atoms results in a decreasing Bragg 
          peak width. Try building a crystal where the number of 
          atoms in each direction is quite different and observe the 
          diffraction pattern. The examples in this section cover 
          all those topics in more detail.</li>
    </ul>

    <font color="#000099">Example 2:</font>
    <ul>
      <li>A plane 'hk' intersects
      the unit cell edges at the points 1/h and 1/k, respectively. If
      h or k are equal to zero, 1/h (1/k) becomes infinity and the
      plane is parallel to the corresponding axis. Note the difference
      between 'h' and '-h'!</li>
      <li> As |h| and |k| increase, the distance d between the planes
      decreases. In a square lattice d is simply d=a/&radic;(h*h+k*k),
      while for a general triclinic lattice you have to take care of
      the angles as well.
      </li>
      <li> Since the planes intersect the unit cell at values 1/h, 1/k
      measured in multiples of the base vectors <b>a</b> and <b>b</b>,
      the planes move along as you increase or decrease the b/a ratio.</li>
      <li> Since the planes are fixed to the unit cell, they strictly
      follow a rotation and a shift of the unit cell. Note, that as you
      shift the unit cell, the distance between the planes does not
      change at all.</li>
      <li> The corresponding Bragg reflection is a vector in reciprocal
      space with indices (h,k). Its direction is normal to the planes, its
      length is inversly proportional to the distance d between the planes.</li>
      <li> The indices (h,k) of the Bragg reflection are inversely
      proportional to the axis intersections in direct space. Correspondingly,
      the effect of changing b/a is inverse to the corresponding
      effect in direct space. As you shorten the b-axis, the length of the
      reciprocal vector along the reciprocal b-axis, i.e. the k-axis
      becomes longer.</li>
      <li> As you increase the angle between the axes in direct space, the
      corresponding angle between the reciprocal axes becomes smaller. The
      Bragg reflection follows this distortion of the reciprocal lattice,
      yet remains normal to the planes.</li>
      <li> The Bragg reflection follows the rotation of the direct lattice,
      while the shift does not affect the position of the Bragg reflections.</li>
      <li> The radiation type does not affect the position of the planes or
      the Bragg reflection.</li>
    </ul>
