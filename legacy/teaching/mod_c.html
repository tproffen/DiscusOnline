  In this third example the real space dimensions of the unit cell are
  inflated by 10 % while the fractional coordinates of the atoms remain
  invariant.
  <p>
  The projection of the structure along [001] in the left image shows the 
  original structure, while the right image shows the modified structure. 
  Note that the distance of all atoms have been increased by a factor of 1.1.  
  The grid gives 0.25 intervalls in fractional coordinates. The origin of 
  the unit cell is at the lower left corner, the horizontal axis is [100], 
  the vertical axis [010].

  Comparison of the Fourier transform of the original unit cell (left image)
  with the Fourier transform of the expanded unit cell (right image) shows
  that the overall shape of the intensity distribution remains the same while
  the reciprocal space dimensions have shrunk 10 %. Get a full screen version
  by clicking on the images below.
  The combined plot of the Fourier transform of the unit cell and the Bragg
  reflections (<font color="#0000FF">blue circles</font>)shows that the 
  positions of the Bragg reflections have changed
  accordingly. They too have shifted closer to the reciprocal space origin.

  The one-dimensional scans do show this phenomenon even more clearly. The new
  Fourier transform (<font color="#FF0000">red curve</font>) is contracted 
  by 10 % compared to the original Fourier transform (<font color="#0000FF">blue
  curve</font>). The scattering intensities of the expanded crystal
  are shown in <font color="#60FF60">green</font>.

  <p>
  Close inspection of the Fourier transforms shows that the corresponding
  maxima of the blue curve are slightly higher than those of the red curve.
  This increase is due to the fact that the maxima have shifted to smaller
  reciprocal space vectors. Closer to the reciprocal space origin the form
  factors of the atoms are larger and thus the calculated intensity increases.
  For neutrons the scattering length is independent of the scattering angle.
  If neutron intensities had been calculated, the intensities would have 
  remained unchanged.
  <p>
  For a real crystal, on the other hand, expansion of the structure is usually
  associated with increased thermal motion, which reduces the observed
  intensities. See examples on the effect of thermal motion.
