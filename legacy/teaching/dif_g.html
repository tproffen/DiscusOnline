  In this section we want to consider a particular kind of disorder known as 
  short range order or short SRO. In broad terms, SRO describes any situation 
  where there is a particular deviation from the average on a local length 
  scale. These deviations can be occupational or displacive. In this section we 
  want to consider the simple case of chemical short range order. Imagine a 
  crystal with a single atom type containing a certain concentration of 
  vacancies. It is common to describe SRO in form of Warren-Cowley short range 
  order or correlation parameters, <i>alpha</i>. The following three cases 
  exist:
  <p>
  <ul>
    <li><font color="DD0000"><i>alpha</i> = 0</font>: This describes a random 
    distribution of vacancies.</li>
    <li><font color="DD0000"><i>alpha</i> &lt; 0</font>: Here we have a 
    tendency for unlike pairs, i.e. vacancies pairs in that direction are 
    <b>less</b> likely to occur compared to the random case.</li>
    <li><font color="DD0000"><i>alpha</i> &gt; 0</font>: In this case there is 
    a tendency to cluster, i.e. vacancies pairs in the given direction are 
    <b>more</b> likely to occur compared to a random distribution.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  The figures below show three different vacancy ordering distributions. In all 
  cases the size of the simulated crystal is 50x50 unit cells with one atom 
  (shown as <font color="00ff00">green dots</font>) per unit cell. The crystal 
  contains 30% vacancies shown in black.  The left figure shows a <i>random</i> 
  distribution. The middle figure corresponds to a <i>positive nearest 
  neighbor</i> correlation. The tendency to have like neighbors along the 
  <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> direction forms the chains of vacancies. Finally the 
  right figure shows a structure with a <i>negative nearest neighbor</i> 
  correlation. It can clearly be seen that the structure contains no vacancy 
  nearest neighbors. Again, you might click on the figures for an enlarged view.

  The structures shown above were created via Monte Carlo (MC) simulations using   the program <a href="http://www.pa.msu.edu/cmp/billinge-group/programs/discus">   DISCUS</a>. A detailed description of the simulation technique is beyond the   scope of this tutorial, interested readers might refer to the DISCUS users guide   for details. Next we look at the corresponding neutron diffraction patterns   shown below. One quadrant of reciprocal space is shown, units are reciprocal   lattice units (see <a href="iunits_b.html">basic examples</a>). The left image   show the pattern for the random vacancy distribution. The diffuse scattering is   essentially uniform (the remaining 'noise' is due to the limited size of the   simulation). The middle figure corresponds to the structure having a positive   nearest neighbor correlation. We can observe diffuse streaks running through the   Bragg positions at integer <i>h</i> and <i>k</i>. The structure with the vacancy   ordering showing a negative correlation produces the diffraction pattern shown   in the right figure. In this case we observer diffuse streaks intersecting half   way between Bragg peak positions.

  Here is a brief mathematical derivation of the diffuse scattering observed. One   can derive the following expression for the diffuse intensity from chemical   ordering alone:

  The first sum is over all chemical species, e.g. AA, AB and BB and the second   sum is over all neighboring vectors <i>r(lmn)</i>. The values <i>alpha</i> are   the correlations, <i>c(i)</i> concentrations of atom type <i>i</i> and   <i>f(i)</i> the scattering power of atom type <i>i</i>. Try simplifying the   expression for vacancies (f=0) and derive the expression for a random   distribution. In that case a uniform diffuse scattering is found. What can be   seen from the expression, that every non-zero correlation contributes a cosine   and the diffuse scattering is simply a sum of those cosines which we simulated   way back in assignment two. Even without mathematics, some information can be   taken from simple inspection of the scattering pattern. A positive correlation   a100 for example creates diffuse streaks through the Bragg peaks parallel to   <i>h</i> and <i>k</i> and a negative a100 will give the same streak between   Bragg peaks. It should also be noted that the scattering intensity is symmetric   around the Bragg positions. Note that in these examples we refer to a100 as the   set of symmetrically equivalent 100 directions.

  The figure above shows a cross section along <i>h</i> of all three scattering patterns. Since Bragg scattering only contains information about the long range   average structure, the Bragg peaks are identical for all three cases, in other   words routine structure refinement could <b>not</b> distinguish between the   three structures shown at the top of this section. The only information one   could extract is the overall concentration of vacancies in the crystal. In order   to obtain information about SRO, one needs to analyze the <i>diffuse   scattering</i>. This illustrates the importance to include diffuse scattering to   obtain a complete structural picture of a given system.
