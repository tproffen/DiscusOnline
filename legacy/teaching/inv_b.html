  Lets reproduce the intensity distributions:

  </center>

  <font color="#000099">
  Why are the two diffraction patterns different?</font><p>
  <ul>
     <li>The left image was calculated for X-ray diffraction. Note
         that the intensities drop with increasing distance from
         the center of reciprocal space.</li>
     <li>The right image was calculated for neutron diffraction.
         Atoms can be treated like point scatterers in this case.
         Accordingly the intensities do not decrease with increasing
         distance from the origin of reciprocal space.</li>
     <li>The atomic form factors increase with the number of
         electrons, while the neutron scattering length do not
         show this systematic distribution. Accordingly the same
         reflection can have totally different intensity as can be
         seen in the diffraction patterns.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  <font color="#000099">
  What information can you extract from the diffraction patterns?</font><p>
  <ul>
     <li>By applying Bragg's law you can calculate the d-spacing for the
         reflections.

        </center>
        There are many different ways to get the lattice constants from
        a list of d-spacings. Since the diffraction pattern in these
        examples are undistorted representations of reciprocal space,
        the lattice constants can be obtained directly from the patterns.
        The two base vectors of reciprocal space are normal to each
        other, of equal length. Base vector <b>a</b> is horizontal,
        base vector <b>b</b> is vertical. The lattice constants are:
        a=b=5.0 A, alpha=90.</li>
    <li>The second information available directly from the diffraction
        pattern is their symmetry. Both diffraction patterns show
        symmetry mm4. There are no systematic extinctions, thus
        the plane group is <b>pmm4</b>. Note that the X-ray pattern
        shows a pseudo c-centering. All reflections hk, h+k=2n+1 are
        very weak. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  <font color="#000099">
  What, if any, information do you need beyond the diffraction patterns
  to solve the crystal structure?</font><p>
  <ul>
     <li>First we need the chemistry of the substance: Zr Ti O<sub>4</sub></li>
     <li>In order to calculate the number of molecules per unit we should
         measure the density of the material.</li>
     <li>Physical properties such as the piezoelectric effect will give
         insight into the presence of a center of symmetry.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  <font color="#000099">
  What type of calculations can you perform to solve the structure?</font><p>
  <ul>
      <li>Direct methods provide the most powerful and usually easiest
          way to solve the structure. They are, however, very much
          black box methods, and beyond the scope of this tutorial.</li>
      <li>A Patterson synthesis can be calculated directly from the
          intensities:
          <center>
            <img src="Pics/invform2.gif" vspace=20 hspace=10 border=0>
          </CENTER> </LI>
  </ul>
  <p>
  Now you are ready for the next step towards a solution of the given
  structure.
